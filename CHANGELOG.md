# Changelog

All notable changes to Kai are documented here.

## [0.10.1] — 2026-04-14

### CLI — `kai init` is now one-shot and low-friction
- **Git history import is automatic** — previously gated behind a `[y/N]` prompt and a `≤1000` commit limit. Now runs unconditionally; `runGitImport` already caps at `importMaxCommits` (default 50), so large repos get their most recent 50 commits silently.
- **Git hooks install without prompting** — post-commit + pre-push hooks are set up automatically in any git repo.
- **MCP server install is auto-detected** — if Claude Code or Codex is on `PATH`, init runs `<tool> mcp list`; if `kai` isn't already registered, it's installed automatically. If it is, init says so and moves on. No prompt either way.
- **kaicontext.com signup is the default path** — the "Would you like to set that up?" gate is gone. Init proceeds straight to asking for an email, sends the magic link, exchanges the token, and signs you in.
- **Already-logged-in users skip signup entirely** — `GetValidAccessToken` is checked first; if valid, the signup copy and email prompt are suppressed.
- **Personal org + repo + first push are fully automatic** — after login, init uses the server-auto-created personal org (or derives a slug from the email local-part as a safety net), calls `DetectProjectName()` for the repo name, creates the repo, wires up `origin`, and pushes. The previous `Repository name [...]:` and `Push your semantic graph now? [Y/n]:` prompts are removed.
- **`kai bench` offer removed from init** — run `kai bench` manually anytime.

### Docs
- **README** — `Quick Start` section rewritten to describe the new one-shot init flow (graph → history → hooks → MCP → account + org + repo + push).

## [0.9.11] — 2026-03-18

### CLI
- **`kai capture -m`** — attach a message to a snapshot, shown as the CI run headline on push
- **`kai fetch --review`** — syncs review comments from the server to the local CLI
- **Push sends git commit message** — `kai push` includes the latest git HEAD message via `X-Kailab-Message` header, used as CI trigger message. Falls back to changeset intent.
- **Review fetch handles duplicates** — re-fetching an existing review syncs comments without erroring

### Reviews (kailayer.com)
- **Comments fixed** — review comments now work end-to-end (SQLite→Postgres migration: repo_id scoping, placeholder syntax, NOT NULL edge constraint)
- **Review page UX** — relative timestamps ("2h ago"), singular/plural grammar fix ("1 file changed"), Merge/Abandon buttons separated with confirmation dialogs, clearer Semantic/Lines toggle active state
- **GetObject API fix** — returns raw content with `X-Kailab-Kind` header for CLI compatibility

### CI
- **Commit messages as run headlines** — CI runs show the git commit message or `kai capture -m` message instead of generic "CI"
- **30-minute default timeouts** — job and step timeouts reduced from 6 hours to 30 minutes (overridable via `timeout-minutes` in workflow YAML)
- **Checkout reliability** — HTTP status checks, 3x retry with backoff, concurrency reduced from 20 to 10 parallel downloads
- **SSE fixes** — fixed `/events` 500 (Flusher passthrough on response wrapper), EventSource cleanup on tab navigation
- **Auto-scroll logs** — log viewer scrolls to bottom on new output

### File View (kailayer.com)
- **File search** — fuzzy filter above the tree with auto-expand on matching directories
- **Type-specific icons** — Go, Markdown, YAML/JSON, Shell files get distinct icons
- **IDE layout** — fixed-height container with independent panel scrolling (tree + content)
- **Better indentation** — 20px per nesting level
- **Loading fix** — no more flash of "No files in this snapshot" while loading

### Header (kailayer.com)
- **Logo mark** — favicon icon next to "Kai" wordmark
- **Refined spacing** — smaller wordmark (18px), consistent 24px nav gaps, `text-sm` nav items
- **Soft shadow** — `box-shadow` instead of hard 1px border
- **Desaturated avatar** — muted gray tint instead of saturated blue

### Infrastructure
- **GCS blob storage** — segments stored inline in Postgres + GCS with range reads for fast file access. Always stores inline as safety net; GCS write is best-effort.
- **Postgres upgraded** — `db-custom-1-3840` (1 vCPU, 3.75GB RAM), max connections raised to 200
- **Connection pool fix** — `SetMaxOpenConns(10)` on both data plane and control plane to prevent pool exhaustion

### Other
- **README links** — SPA navigation for internal links in rendered markdown
- **`kai push --force`** — skips negotiate for data recovery (re-sends all objects)

## [0.9.10] — 2026-03-16

### CLI
- **`kai query` command group** — query the semantic graph directly from the terminal:
  - `kai query callers <symbol>` — find all call sites with file:line locations
  - `kai query dependents <file>` — find all files that import a given file
  - `kai query impact <file>` — transitive downstream impact analysis with hop distance, separating source files from tests
- **`kai analyze` summary output** — `kai analyze symbols` and `kai analyze calls` now print what they found (e.g., "Found 61 symbols across 11 files", "Found 36 imports, 50 calls, 16 test links")

## [0.9.9] — 2026-03-14

### MCP
- **`kai_files` MCP tool** — list files in a repo with language, module, and glob pattern filters
- **MCP call logging** — JSONL logging for measuring tool usage, gated on `KAI_MCP_LOG=1`. Captures tool name, params, duration, extracted file/symbol references per session
- **SER analysis script** — `scripts/analyze-mcp-log.py` computes Structured Exploration Ratio with A/B comparison mode

### Review System
- **`kai review edit`** — update title, description, and assignees after creation
- **`kai review comment`** — add comments with `--file` and `--line` anchoring
- **`kai review comments`** — list all comments on a review
- **Review model alignment** — CLI and server now share the same data model: assignees, comment threading (parentId), changesRequestedSummary/By, targetBranch
- **Review state validation** — state machine enforcement on both CLI and server (draft→open→approved/changes_requested→merged/abandoned)
- **Review summary persistence** — `kai review summary` stores structured summary in the review payload, accessible via web UI
- **Language-aware API surface detection** — Go (uppercase), Python (no `_` prefix), Ruby (all public), Rust (uppercase types), JS/TS (top-level functions/classes)
- **Module-based file categorization** — review summaries load modules from `.kai/rules/modules.yaml` for meaningful grouping
- **Unified diff in reviews** — `kai review view` shows proper unified diffs

### Capture & Push
- **Quiet output** — one-line summary by default (`Captured abc123 (191 files, 20 modified)`), inline progress counters, full detail with `-v`
- **Snapshot history** — each capture preserves the previous snapshot as `snap.YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.mmm`, browsable in the web UI and CLI
- **`kai snapshot list`** — now shows ref names alongside IDs

### Snapshots & Refs
- **`@snap:` ref resolution** — `@snap:snap.20260314T090755.729` and `@snap:20260314T090755.729` both work
- **`kai diff` with historical snapshots** — `kai diff snap.20260314T085932 snap.latest --semantic`

### kailayer.com
- **Web review creation** — "New Review" button on Reviews tab with changeset selector, title, and description fields
- **Raw endpoint fix** — serves `text/plain` with `nosniff` header so HTML source is displayed, not rendered
- **Skeleton loaders** — all loading states show animated skeleton placeholders matching the content shape
- **File-first loading** — file content renders immediately while the file tree loads in the background
- **Consistent page padding** — all repo pages now use matching `px-5 py-8`
- **kai-core auto-sync** — CI pulls latest kai-core from OSS repo before every build, no more drift
- **State transition validation** — server enforces same state machine as CLI

### Other
- Removed dead kailab/kailab-control build jobs from OSS CI
